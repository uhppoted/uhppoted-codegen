# Basic Guide to Using uhppoted-codegen

_uhppoted-codegen_ is essentially just a templating something that translates templatized documents into language specific
code - nothing special and there are dozens of similar (and probably more powerful) implementations out there. Its one claim
to fame is that it includes a set of models for interacting with a UHPPOTE Wiegand controller (although those models can be 
and are exported to JSON so it's perfectly possible to use an alternative templating engine of your choice. But why would
you :-)).

For better or worse, this documents describes the basics of creating a UHPPOTE language specific binding with _uhppoted-codegen_.
