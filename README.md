## Installation

Executables for all the supported operating systems are packaged in the [releases](https://github.com/uhppoted/uhppoted-codegen/releases):

The release tarballs contain the executables for all the operating systems - OS specific tarballs with all the _uhppoted_ components can be found in [uhpppoted](https://github.com/uhppoted/uhppoted/releases) releases.

Installation is straightforward - download the archive and extract it to a directory of your choice. 

`uhppoted-codegen help` will list the available commands and associated options (documented below).

### Building from source

Required tools:
- [Go 1.18+](https://go.dev)
- make (optional but recommended)

To build using the included Makefile:

```
git clone https://github.com/uhppoted/uhppoted-codegen.git
cd uhppoted-codegen
make build
```

Without using `make`:
```
git clone https://github.com/uhppoted/uhppoted-codegen.git
cd uhppoted-codegen
go build -trimpath -o bin/ ./...
```

The above commands build the `uhppoted-codegen` executable to the `bin` directory.
